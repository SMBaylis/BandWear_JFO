### Contents

These are the code and data files for "Estimates of wear rates in metal bird bands, with applications in survival and movement models for marked individuals", scheduled for publication in the December 2018 issue of the Journal of Field Ornithology.

The R script mentioned in the body of the manuscript is "Archived R code for Band Wear Table v0.4.R". Some users have reported issues with this script file on Windows machines, so the script is also included as "Archived R code for Band Wear Table v0.4.txt"

The other files in this archive are data objects called by the R script or outputs from part way through the analysis script. The output files allow the analysis to be restarted without rerunning the entire script. If you *do* run the whole script, the output files will be overwritten, but the new version will be the same as the original.

All scripts, data, and analysis were generated or undertaken under Ubuntu 16.04, running R version 3.4.4 or below under GNU Emacs 24.5.1 or below with ESS 17.11 or below.
